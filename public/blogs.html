        <h2>How Does React Work?</h2>
        <p>ReactJS is one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for mobile and web application development. Created by Facebook, React contains a collection of reusable JavaScript code snippets used for user interface (UI) building called components. It’s important to note that ReactJS is not a JavaScript framework. That’s because it’s only responsible for rendering the components of an application’s view layer. React is an alternative to frameworks like Angular and Vue, which all allow to create complex functions.
    
        This article will explore React’s features, explain how it works, and go over its benefits for front-end developers. We’ll also cover the differences between ReactJS and React Native regarding their roles in the web and mobile app development industry.</p>

        <h2>State Vs Props Difference</h2>
        <p>State,
            The state is an updatable structure that is used to contain data or information about the component and can change over time. The change in state can happen as a response to user action or system event. It is the heart of the react component which determines the behavior of the component and how it will render. A state must be kept as simple as possible. It represents the component's local state or information. It can only be accessed or modified inside the component or by the component directly.
            
            Props,
            Props are read-only components. It is an object which stores the value of attributes of a tag and work similar to the HTML attributes. It allows passing data from one component to other components. It is similar to function arguments and can be passed to the component the same way as arguments passed in a function. Props are immutable so we cannot modify the props from inside the component.</p>

            <h2>React useState</h2>
            <p>The useState() is a Hook that allows you to have state variables in functional components . so basically useState is the ability to encapsulate local state in a functional component. React has two types of components, one is class components which are ES6 classes that extend from React and the other is functional components. Class components a Component and can have state and lifecycle methods: class Message extends React. The  useState hook is a special function that takes the initial state as an argument and returns an array of two entries.  UseState encapsulate only singular value from the state, for multiple state need to have useState calls.

                Syntax: The first element is the initial state and the second one is a function that is used for updating the state.</p>
